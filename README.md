 This is a student project from our second semester of Computer Science and Media.
 
 I read CleanCode shortly after building this, which made me a little sad, since this is a bit convoluted and has huge classes.
 It works, however, can compile to JAR and EXE and most importantly, has DARK MODE built in from the beginning - looking at you, StackOverflow and github!
